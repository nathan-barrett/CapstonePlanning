## Description:
This is the planning document for my Capstone project at Epicodus. I am planning on using react native to make a app that allows people to plan dog dates.

## Planning Objectives:

- [x] Research more about React Native

- [x] Break the UI into a Component Hierarchy

- [ ] Build a Static version the application

- [ ] Identify the Minimum representation of state

- [ ] Lift state

- [ ] Add inverse data

## Notes on React Native

* The first thing that I am going to do to try and prepare myself to make this Application is do some more research about react native itself.
* Go to the lesson on React Native from Learn How to Program
* Go through the tutorial from the React Native deocumentation
* Watch travesty media's video called React Native Crash Course

## React Crash Course Video
 - Framework, not a library (like react).
 - Can build cross platform applications.
 - Uses a lot of the same information that React uses (state, props, etc.)
 - UI Component Examples:
  - TextImput, Picker, Switch, Slider
  - Touchable Elements
  - Listview and Scrollview
  - ALerts Modals and ProgressBars
  - StatusBar
  - TabBar iOS
  - Toolbar
 Api's for device interaction
 - Camera Roll (this is a big deal
 - Vibration

##  React Native using create-react-native CLI
I downloaded the command line interface because the documentation and learing to program suggested it was the best place to start.

I was working through different tutorials, and I decided on making my actual capstone using the react-native cli rather than the create-react-native-app cli, because I feel like I will have more control over the development build for my project.

I've spent a few hours just going through the tutorials and looking over some documentation abut the different components in the react native frameowork.
